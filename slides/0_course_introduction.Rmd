# About This Class

- This is the first teaching of this variation of this class!

- Please tell me what you like and what you don't like.

# Covid Contingency Plans

- The class is in-person unless the University changes course.
--


  + I do not control this.

--


- There will always be a Zoom option:

  + Let me know ahead of time if you are planning to Zoom. 
  + Use the Zoom option for circumstances when you really can't be here
  (i.e. you or your family are sick, an emergency has kept you home, travel disruptions).
  + You don't have to tell me why you are zooming in.
  
---

# Covid Contingency Plans

- If you are sick or test positive: 
  + Don't come to class, zoom in if you feel well enough.
  + Watch lectures asynchronously if needed. 
  + Let me know.
  
- If I am sick or test positive:
  + If I test positive but am not symptomatic, class will be held by zoom. 
  + We may have to do asynchronous lectures, or I will ask someone to fill in. 

- Hopefully we all stay healthy.
