# Recap: IP Weighting

- Last lecture we looked at parametric versions of IP weighting and standardization. 

- In IP weighting, we propose a parametric estimator of $\pi(L) = P[ A = 1 \vert L ]$ 
  + $\pi(L)$ is the *propensity score*. 

- The IP weight for uint $i$ is $1/\pi(L_i)$ if $A_i = 1$ or $1/(1-\pi(L_i))$ if $A_i = 0$. 

- We can then use this weight in a marginal structural model to estimate a causal parameter. 

- Recall a marginal structural model relates a potential outcome to our observed variables
$$
E[Y(a)] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 a
$$

---
# Recap: Outcome Regression 

- The alternative to specifying a model for $\pi(L)$ is to specify a model for the outcome, $E[Y \vert A=a, L] = b_a(L)$

- If $b_a(L)$ is correctly specified, we can estimate $E[Y(a)]$ by standardization. 

- In some cases, the coefficient on $A$ is directly interpretable as a causal parameter. 
  + This happens when there are no product terms between $A$ and $L$. 

---

# Outcome Regression

- Last time, we fit a linear regression that included a product term between the treatment (quitting smoking) and smoking intensity. 

$$
E[Y \vert A, L] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 A + \beta_2 A L_1 + \beta_3 L_1 + \dots 
$$

- Using standardization, we can still use this model to obtain the marginal effect. 

- Without standardization, we can interpret $\beta_1 + \beta_2 l$ as the average effect of quitting smoking for individuals with initial smoking intensity $l$. 

---
# Drawbacks of Outcome Regression 

- It is hard to correctly specify the $E[Y \vert A, L]$.

- This problem gets harder as the dimension of $L$ increases. 

- The form of effect modification by $L$ could be very complex. 

- We will probably be tempted to fit an overly simple model, which may give biased inference. 

---
# Propensity Scores

- $\pi(L) = P[A = 1 \vert L]$, the probability of receiving treatment conditional on confounders $L$ is the *propensity score*. 

- Within strata of $\pi(L)$, the distribution of $L$ will be the same in cases and controls. 
  - $\pi(l)$ is a *balancing score*. 
  
$$
A \ci L \vert\ \pi(L)
$$

- The propensity score is the coarsest possible balancing score: If $b(L)$ is a balancing score then $b(L) = f(\pi(L))$ for some function $f$. 
  + The finest possible balancing score is $A$. 

---
# Propensity Scores are Sufficient for Confounder Adjustment

- If $Y(a) \ci A \vert L$, and positivity holds, and $b(L)$ is a balancing score,

- Then $Y$ and $A$ are exchangeable conditional on $b(L)$, $Y(a) \ci A \vert\ b(L)$.
  
- The propensity score is like an intermediate node in the DAG mediating all arrows going into $A$.


---
# Propensity Scores and Positivity

- If positivity holds, propensity scores should be bounded away from 0 and 1:
  
  + Everyone should have some chance of having receiving either. 
  + Propensity scores close to 0 and 1 happen when there is perfect separation by one or a combination of confounders. 
  + There may be structural positivity violations. 

- Propensity scores should have approximately the same range in both groups. 

  + Non-overlapping ranges suggest random positivity violations (could also be structural). 
  + Ok for IP weighting but a problem for matching and subclassification.

# Outcome Regression with Propensity Scores

- Because $\pi(L)$ is sufficient to control confounding, we could propose a model for $E[Y(a) \vert L]$ in terms of one-dimensional $\pi(L)$ rather than high dimensional $L$.

- Valid inference will depend on 
  + Correctly estimating $\pi(L)$
  + Correctly specifying the functional form of $E[Y \vert A , \pi(L)]$
  
  
- A simple model like $$E[Y \vert A, \pi(L)] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 A + \beta_2 \pi(L)$$ is probably insufficient to control for confounding.

---
# Outcome Regression with Propensity Scores

- Because $\pi(L)$ is one-dimensional, it is easy to propose a flexible model. 

- Models which include no effect modification of $A$ by $L$ could include: 
  + Fitting a cubic spline for effect of $\pi(L)$
  + Dividing $\pi(L)$ into deciles and fitting an effect for nine binary indicators decile membership. 
  
  
---

# Stratification/Subclassification

- Stratification over quantiles of $\hat{\pi}(L)$ allows us to estimate a flexible model *with* effect modification by $\pi(L).$ 

- Let $\hat{C}_k = [\hat{c}_{k-1}, \hat{c}_k)$, $k = 1, \dots, K$ be non-overlapping intervals dividing the observed range of $\hat{\pi}(L)$. 

- Within each interval, we estimate 

$$\hat{E}[Y(a) \vert \hat{\pi} \in \hat{C}_i] = E[Y \vert A = a, \hat{\pi} \in \hat{C}_i] \\\
= \frac{1}{n_{1,k}}\sum_{i=1}^{N}A_i Y_i 1_{\hat{\pi} \in \hat{C}_i} - \frac{1}{n_{0,k}}\sum_{i=1}^{N}(1-A_i) Y_i 1_{\hat{\pi} \in \hat{C}_i}$$

- This is the same as fitting the saturated linear regression 

$$E[Y \vert A, \hat{\pi}(L)] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 A + \sum_{j=2}^{K}\beta_j 1_{\hat{\pi} \in \hat{C}_j} + \sum_{j =2}^{K} \beta_{K-1 + j} A 1_{\hat{\pi} \in \hat{C}_j}$$ 
---

# Subclassification and Standardization

- We can then compute an estimate of $E[Y(a)]$ using our standardization formula

$$\hat{\Delta}_S = \sum_{k = 1}^K \frac{n_k}{N} \left\lbrace \frac{1}{n_{1,k}}\sum_{i=1}^{N}A_i Y_i 1_{\hat{\pi} \in \hat{C}_i} - \frac{1}{n_{0,k}}\sum_{i=1}^{N}(1-A_i) Y_i 1_{\hat{\pi} \in \hat{C}_i} \right \rbrace$$

# Number and Size of Divisions

- Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) suggest using sample quintiles ( $K=5$ ). 
  + This generally leads to residual bias. 

- More intervals leads to less bias but increased variance. 

- The optimal choice of $K$ and interval endpoints is an open problem.

- Intervals must be large enough that individuals with both treatments are in every interval. 

---
# $\hat{\Delta}_S$ is a Coarsened Horvitz-Thompson Estimator

- Recall the IP weighted Horvitz-Thompson estimator:

$$\hat{\Delta}_{HT} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{A_i Y_i}{\hat{\pi}_i} - \frac{(1-A_i)Y_i}{1-\hat{\pi}_i}$$
- Within each interval, estimate a "subclass-specific" propensity score, $\hat{p}_k = P[A_i = 1 \vert \hat{\pi}_i \in \hat{C}_k] = \frac{n_{1,k}}{n_k}$.

- For each individual, set $\hat{\pi}^{C}_i = \sum_k 1_{\hat{\pi}_i \in \hat{C}_k}p_{k}.$

- Plug these propensity scores into the formula for $\hat{\Delta}_{HT}$ and get $\hat{\Delta}_S.$

---

# Asymptotic Results

- Suppose that we have a rule for picking the number divisions that is a function of the data.

- Is there a rule such that $\hat{\Delta}_S$ is root-N consistent for the ATE?

--

- Wang et al (2016) show that

- Consistency requires that $K(N)/\sqrt{N} \rightarrow \infty$ as $N \rightarrow \infty$

- In order for $\hat{\Delta}_S$ to be well defined, $K(N)$ must grow slowly enough that there are always units with both values of $A$ in every division.
  + $[ K(N)log(K(N))]/N \rightarrow 0$ as $N \rightarrow \infty$

---
# Full Subclassification 

- Wang et al (2016) propose a strategy for allowing $K$ to grow with $N$ called full subclassification. 

- Choose the largest number $K$ such that every $1/K$ quantile of $\hat{\pi}$ has at least one case and at least one control. 

---

# Comparison with IP Weighting

- Both IP weighting and outcome regression with PS require a correct model for $E[A = 1 \vert L ]$. 

- Both require a correct marginal model for the relationship between $Y(a)$ and $a$ (easy if $A$ is dichotomous). 

- Outcome regression with propensity scores additionally requires correctly specifying the relationship between $Y(a)$ and $\pi(L)$. 

- Stratification/standardization allows us to use a very flexible model for the $Y$ - $\pi$ relationship. 
  - Some bias may remain if intervals are too wide. 
  
---

# Comparison with IP Weighting

- IP Weighting:
  + Asymptotically unbiased
  + High variance if some weights are large
  + Very sensitive to misspecification of model for $\pi(L)$
  
  
  
- PS Stratification
  + Biased for fixed value of $K$.
  + Lower variance in some cases. 
  + Less sensitive to misspecification of model for $\pi(L)$
  
- In PS Stratification, we only rely on $\hat{\pi}(L)$ to group units with similar propensities. 

---
# Within Stratum Regression Modeling

- Bias in $\hat{\Delta}_S$ occurs because $L$ and $A$ may not be independent within intervals. 

- One strategy to deal with this is to fit an outcome regression model for $E[Y \vert A, L]$ *within* each $\hat{C}_k$.

- Let $\hat{Y}_{a,i,k}$ be the estimate of $E[Y \vert A = a, L = L_i]$ from the model fit within $\hat{C}_k$. 

$$\hat{\Delta}_{OR,k} = \frac{1}{n_k}\sum_{i = 1}^{N}1_{\hat{\pi_i} \in \hat{C}} \left(\hat{Y}_{1,i,k} - \hat{Y}_{0, i, k}\right)$$

$$\hat{\Delta}_{SR} = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \frac{n_k}{N}\hat{\Delta}_{OR,k}$$

- If the form of the outcome-regression is correct, this strategy will be consistent. 

  
---
# Double Robust Methods

- Double robust methods combine propensity weighting and outcome regression approaches.

- DR methods are consistent if *either* the propensity score model or the outcome regression model is correctly specified. 

- They can still be biased if both models are misspecified. 

- Technically, $\hat{\Delta}_{SR}$ is not doubly robust because it is inconsistent for fixed $K$ if the outcome model is wrong. 


---
# Doubly Robust Estimation

- Suppose we have an outcome regression model.

- For each unit, we can estimate $\hat{Y}_{a, i} = E[Y \vert A = a, L = L_i]$. 

- We can construct estimators for $E[Y(1)]$ and $E[Y(0)]$ as 

$$\hat{\Delta}_{DR,1} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i = 1}^N \left \lbrace  \frac{A_i Y_i}{\hat{\pi}(L_i)} - \left(\frac{A_i}{\hat{\pi}(L_i)} - 1 \right)\hat{Y}_{1,i} \right \rbrace$$


$$\hat{\Delta}_{DR,0} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i = 1}^N \left \lbrace  \frac{(1-A_i) Y_i}{1-\hat{\pi}(L_i)} - \left(\frac{1-A_i}{1-\hat{\pi}(L_i)} - 1 \right)\hat{Y}_{0,i} \right \rbrace$$
 - Cassel, Särndal, and Wretman (1976); Robins, Rotnitzky, and Zhao (1994)
---
# Doubly Robust Estimation

$$\hat{\Delta}_{DR,1} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i = 1}^N \left \lbrace  \frac{A_i Y_i}{\hat{\pi}(L_i)} - \left(\frac{A_i}{\hat{\pi}(L_i)} - 1 \right)\hat{Y}_{1,i} \right \rbrace \\\
= \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i = 1}^N \left \lbrace \hat{Y}_{1,i} + \frac{A_i}{\hat{\pi}(L_i)}\left(Y_i - \hat{Y}_{1,i} \right) \right \rbrace$$

- If the model for $\hat{\pi}$ is correct then $E\left [\frac{A_i}{\hat{\pi}(L_i)}\right] = 1$. 

- If the model for $\hat{Y}$ is correct then $E[A_i(Y_i - \hat{Y}_{1,i})] = 0$. 

---
# Doubly Robust Estimation

- $\hat{\Delta}_{DR} = \hat{\Delta}_{DR,1} - \hat{\Delta}_{DR,0}$ is the locally semiparametrically efficient estimator. 

- If both models are correctly specified, then, 

- Asymptotically, $\hat{\Delta}_{DR}$ has the smallest variance among estimators in the defined by Robins and Ronitzky (1995).

- $\hat{\Delta}_{DR}$ is an augmented inverse probability weighted estimator (AIPW).

---
# Regression with Propensity Score

- Another method to form a DR estimator is to fit an outcome regression model adding some function(s) of $\hat{\pi}$ as covariates. 


- Scharfstein et al (1999) show that including $\frac{1}{\hat{\pi}}$ as a covariate is sufficient to achieve double robustness. 

- Suppose that our outcome regression model is $E[Y \vert A, L] = s(A, L, \beta)$, where $\beta$ are parameters to be estimated. 

- We then fit the augmented mode $E[Y \vert A, L] = s(A, L, \beta) + \phi f(A, L)$. 
- We then define $\tilde{Y}_{a,i} = s(a, L_i, \hat{\beta}) + \hat{\phi}f(a, L_i)$

- And estimate
$$\hat{\Delta}_{DR2} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_i \tilde{Y}_{1,i} - \tilde{Y}_{0,i}$$


---
# Regression with Propensity Score

- Bang and Robins (2005) extend the idea of adding a clever covarite. 

- They show that adding $f(A, L) = \frac{A_1}{\hat{\pi_i}} + \frac{1-A_i}{1-\hat{\pi}_i}$ also gives a DR estimator.

- This estimator is more efficient than the Scharfstein et al eestimator when only the outcome model is correct.

# Bias of Doubly Robust Methods

- The bias of all doubly robust methods is a product of the bias of $1/\hat{\pi}(L)$ and the bias of $\hat{b}(L) = \hat{E}[Y \vert A = a, L]$.

- Kang and Schaffer (2007) demonstrate a simulated example where the bias of the DR estimator is larger than the bias of the OLS estimate when both models are misspecified.


---
# Kang and Schaffer (2007)

- Kang and Schaffer (2007) construct a simulation experiment where it would be hard to get either the outcome or the exposure models correct. 

- Data are generated as 
$$Y_i = \alpha_0 + \sum_{j = 1}^4 \alpha_i Z_{j,i}\qquad \pi_i = expit(\sum_{j = 1}^{4} \beta_j Z_{j,i})$$
- Rather than observing $Z_1, \dots, Z_4$, we observe non-linear transformations

$$X_{1,i} = e^{Z_{1,i}/2} \qquad X_{2,i} = \frac{Z_{2,i}}{1 + e^{Z_{1,i}}} + 10 \\\
X_{3,i} = (Z_{1,i} Z_{3,i}/25 + 0.6)^3 \qquad X_{4,i} = (Z_2 + Z_4 + 20)^2$$

# What to Include in a Propensity Score Model

- We have seen that all variables needed to block backdoor paths should be included in the propensity score model. 

- We should not include colliders (or children of colliders), even if they improve our predictions of $A$. 

- What about other variables? 

  
---

# Example

- Should we include $L_1$ in in the predictive model of $A$?

- Suppose that $P[A = 1 \vert L = 0] = 0.01$ and $P[A = 1 \vert L_1 = 1]= 0.99$ and we condition on $L_1$ to compute $\hat{\pi}(L)$.

- 1% of our sample will have a weight of 100, while the remaining 99% will have a weight close to 1. 
- The weighted estimator will have a much higher variance than the (also valid) unweighted estimator.

# Example

- Should we include $L_2$ in in the predictive model of $A$? 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height = 2.5}
ndf2 <- create_node_df(n = 3, label = c("A", "Y", "L@_{2}"), 
                     fontname = "Helvetica", 
                     fontsize = 10, 
                     width = 0.3, 
                     fillcolor = "white", 
                     fontcolor = "black",
                     color = "black", 
                     shape = "circle",
                     x = c(0, 1,  0.5)*1, 
                     y = c(0, 0, 1)*0.5)
edf2 <- create_edge_df(from = c(1, 3), to = c(2, 2),
                          minlen = 1, 
                          color = "black", 
                          )
gr2 <- create_graph(nodes_df = ndf2, edges_df = edf2)

render_graph(gr2)

# Conditionality Prinicipal

- In a randomized experiment, $Y(a) \ci A$ unconditionally *on average*.

- So the true value of $\pi(L)$ is constant for all individuals. 

- However, in any given realization of the experiment, there may be imbalances in some confounders. 
  + These imbalances can lead to bias even though they are "accidental". 
  
- Adjusting for the estimated value, $\hat{\pi}(L)$ can eliminate this bias. 

- Even if we knew the true value of $\pi(L)$, it would be better to use the estimates. 

---
# Simulations 

- Data are generated from the graph: 
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height = 2.5}
ndf2$lable[3] <- "Y"
edf2 <- create_edge_df(from = c( 3), to = c( 2),
                          minlen = 1, 
                          color = "black", 
                          )
gr2 <- create_graph(nodes_df = ndf2, edges_df = edf2)

render_graph(gr2)
```

- A randomized trial with $N/2$ units each in treatment and control groups. 

- $A$, $Y$, and $L$ are all binary. 

- $P[Y = 1 \vert L ] = 0.05 + 0.5 L$; $P[L = 1] = 0.5$. 

- In each simulation, we sample 250 units from this model and compute 
  + $\hat{\beta}$, the sample difference in means and 
  + $\hat{\beta}_S$, the stratified difference in means estimate. 

<!-- - Recall that $\hat{\beta}_S$ is the same as the IP weighted estimate because all of our variables are binary.  -->

# Simulation Results 

- Over 1000 simulations, 

- The average absolute bias times $\sqrt{N}$ is 
  + $\hat{\beta}$: `r round(with(xx, mean(abs(bhat.A)))*sqrt(250), digits = 2)`
  + $\hat{\beta}_S$: `r round(with(xx, mean(abs(bhat_strat.A)))*sqrt(250), digits = 2)`

- The Monte Carlo variance of each estimator time $\sqrt{N}$ is
  + $\hat{\beta}$: `r round(with(xx, var(abs(bhat.A*sqrt(250)))), digits =2)`
  + $\hat{\beta}_S$: `r round(with(xx, var(abs(bhat_strat.A*sqrt(250)))), digits =2)`

- The adjusted estimator has lower bias and is more precise.

# Matching

- Recall our previous discussion of matching for a single variable. 

- For binary or discrete $L$, for each person with $A = 1$, we select a control with matching $L$ value. 

- We leave out any samples that cannot be matched. 

- Using this new matched sample, we can compute the average treatment effect among the treated. 

- Alternatively, we could match to the untreated population or any other distribution of $L$.

- Today, we assume we are matching to the treated population. 

- Content in this section draws heavily from Stuart (2010).

---

# Matching when $L$ is High Dimensional

- For high dimensional $L$, we probably cannot find exact matches. 

- Instead, we can define a distance measure and match cases with "close" controls. 

- We could define our distance using the full vector of $L$
  + E.g the Mahalanobis distance $D_{i,j} = (L_i - L_j)^\top \Sigma^{-1} (L_i - L_j)$
  + $\Sigma$ is the sample covariance of $L$ in controls if matching to the treated. 

- Or we could define our distance based on the propensity score: 
  + Absolute difference $D_{i,j} = \vert \hat{\pi}_i - \hat{\pi}_j \vert$
  + Difference in logits $D_{i,j} = \vert logit(\hat{\pi}_i) - logit(\hat{\pi}_j )\vert$

---
# Defining "Close"

- We have another bias-variance trade-off.  

- If matching criteria are too stringent, we throw out a lot of data and variance increases.

- If matching criteria are too loose, confounding remains and we have bias. 

<!-- # Target Population -->

<!-- - If every treated individual is matched to one (or more) untreated individuals, the target population is the population of the treated.  -->

<!-- - If some treated individuals are left out because they cannot be matched, the population is now harder to describe.  -->

<!-- - We are estimating the effect in a subset of the population defined by propensity score.  -->

<!-- - It may be more natural to restrict the population based on sets of individuals in $L$ (e.g. smoking intensity).  -->

---
# Nearest Neighbor Matching

- The simplest matching strategy is to match every case to its nearest control with no cap on maximum distance. 

- We could also match every case to its $k$ nearest controls. 

- This method can lead to some bad matches. 

- We could set a maximum distance and discard cases that have no match within that distance. 

- This changes the target population. 

- It may be more interpretable to restrict the population based on sets of individuals in $L$ (e.g. smoking intensity). 

---
# Nearest Neighbor Variations

- Optimal matching: Rather than "greedily" choose the match closest to each case one at a time, try to minimize a global distance measure. 

- Ratio matching: Choose multiple matches per case.
   + May reduce bias by increasing sample size.
   + May result in poor matches for some units.
   + Variable ratio matching allows different indviduals to have different numbers of matches. (Requires weighting in analysis)
   
- Matching with replacement: Allow multiple cases to match to the same control. 
  + Can decrease bias by improving match quality. 
  + Requires weighting in analysis. 

---
# Subclassification

- The subclassification estimator $\hat{\Delta}_S$ is a form of matching estimator. 

- When we divide individuals into groups based on PS, multiple cases and multiple controls are in the same group. 

- The $\hat{\Delta}_S$ estimator weights the estimate within each stratum by the proportion of total individuals in that stratum.

- We could instead weight by the proportion of treated individuals in order to estimate the ATT. 

---
# Full Matching


- In full matching, rather than pre-selecting the number of classes, we use the maximum number that allow us to have at least one case and one control in each class. 

- We identify subclasses such that:

- Every subclass contains at least one case and one control.
  + Can be 1:1, 1:many, or many:1

- A measure of global distance is minimized over all possible full matches. 

---

# Analysis Using the Matched Sample

- Different matching schemes require different analysis strategies. 

- In variable ratio matching, each control is weighted according to the number of other controls in its group. 
  + If a group contains 1 case and 4 controls, each control is weighted 1/4.
  
- If matching with replacement, unit $i$ weighted by $1/n_i$ where $n_i$ is the number of times unit $i$ was sampled. 

- For all of the NN matching schemes, we can either:
  + Simply compute a weighted difference in means. 
  + Fit an outcome regression model using the matched sample and any necessary weights. 
  
+ Fitting an outcome regression model in a matched sample is analogous to the double robustness strategy. 

---
# Analysis Using Full Matching 

- Recall that in subclassification, we could fit an outcome regression within each subclass (the $\hat{\Delta}_{SR}$ estimator). 

- In full matching, we can't fit a regression within each subclass. 

- Instead we fit a model to all data shared coefficients for covariates but subclass specific coefficients for treatment. 

$$E[Y_{i,k} \vert A, L] = \beta_{0,k} + \beta_{1,k}A_{i,k} + \gamma L_{i,k}$$
- We then average subclass effects to obtain 
$$\hat{\beta} = \frac{n_k}{N}\sum_{k} \hat{\beta}_{1,k}$$
---
# Variance Estimation

- Rubin and Thomas (1996) and Rubin and Stuart (2006) argue that we don't need to account for uncertainty in in estimating propensity scores because not doing so will be conservative. 

- Another alternative is the bootstrap. 

- Abadie and Imbens (2006) provide a large sample estimator of the variance for 1:k matching with replacement. 


---
# Assessing Matches

- If matching is successful, then all variables in $L$ should be balanced between cases and controls in the matched population. 

- To determine if matching is adequate to control confounding, we need to check that this is true. 

- Ideally we could compare the full multivariate distribution of $L$ between cases and controls, but this is too complicated. 

- Instead we look at each variable individually. 
  + Should also look at products and squares. 
  
---
# Assessing Matches

- Rubin (2001) suggests three balance measures:

1. Standardized difference in means of the propensity score.(Should be  < 0.25)
1. Ratio of the variances of the propensity score in treated and control. (Should be between 0.5 and 2)
1. For each covariate, ratio of the variance after regressing out the propensity score. (Should be between 0.5 and 2)

---
# $p$-Values are Unsuitable to Assess Balance

- Balance is an in-sample property, it doesn't make sense to test a super-population hypothesis.

- The $p$-value may increase after matching simply because the power has decreased due to throwing out samples.

# Structural Marginal Models

- Recall previously, we wanted to estimate the causal effect of quitting smoking across strata of a variable $V$ (sex). 

- We proposed a structural marginal model 

$$
E[Y(a) \vert V] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 a + \beta_2 a V + \beta_3 V
$$

- The causal contrasts we are interested in are $E[Y(1)-Y(0) \vert V = 0]$ and $E[Y(1)-Y(0) \vert V = 1]$.

- These correspond to parameters $\beta_1$ and $\beta_1 + \beta_2$ in the marginal model. 
  + We have estimated two more parameters than we needed to answer the causal question. 
  
---
# Semiparametric Structrual Marginal Models

- Instead of proposing a model for $E[Y(a) \vert V]$, we could have proposed a model directly for the contrast we care about 

$$
E[Y(1)-Y(0) \vert V] = \beta_1 a + \beta_2 a V
$$

- This is a *semiparametric marginal structural model*. 

- It is semiparametric because we don't specify $\beta_0$ and $\beta_3$. 

---
# Semiparametric Structrual Marginal Models

- When $A$ and $V$ are both binary, the structural marginal model we proposed was saturated. 

- We weren't relying on any parametric assumptions so there is no use in becoming semiparametric. 

- However, in more complex situations, using a semiparametric model can be more robust. 



---
# Structural Nested Mean Models

- In the settings we have seen so far with no time varying treatments, semiparametric nested mean models are semiparametric marginal structural models. 
- The term *nested* will become relevant for problems with time-varying treatments.
