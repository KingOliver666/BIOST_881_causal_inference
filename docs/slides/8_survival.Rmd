# Plan

1. Survival analysis Review

2. Causal analysis of time to event outcomes for a point treatment. 

3. Introduction about time varying treatments. 

$\newcommand{\ci}{\perp\!\!\!\perp}$

---

# Time to Event Data

- Simplest setting: 

- Participants are enrolled into a study at time 0 and receive a treatment $A$. 

- Participants are followed until either they die or the study ends. 

- We want to know if people who receive $A =1$ live longer than people who receive $A = 0$. 

- The NHEFS study falls into this framework.
  + Administrative end of followup is Dec 31, 1992.
  + We might like to know if there is a difference in survival time for quitters and non-quitters.

---

# Time to Event Data

- Let $T_i$ be the time of death for unit $i$. 
  + We can have counterfactual times of death $T_i(1)$ and $T_i(0)$.
  
- If we follow all participants until the die, $T$ is just an outcome like weight change, any of the tools we have learned so far apply. 

- Administrative censoring poses a problem: $T$ is missing for participants with the longest survival times.

# Time to Event Data

Given this intractible censoring problem, we have two options:

1. Ask questions about time-specific survival (e.g. 120 month survival) or risk rather than questions about overall survival time. 

2. Use structural nested accelerated failure time models to estimate ratios of survival times comparing $A = a$ to $A = 0$. 

---
# Survival 

- Let $t_1, \dots, t_K$ be discrete, evenly spaced, time points at which data are recorded. Define $t_0$ to be the beginning of the study. 

- Let $D_{i, k}$ be an indicator that unit $i$ has died before (or at) time $t_k$: $D_{i,k} = I(T_i \leq t_k)$

- Survival, $S_{i,k} = P[T_i > t_k] = E[1-D_{i,k}]$, is the probability of unit $i$ living beyond time $t_k$. 

- Alternatively, we might prefer risk $R_{i,k} = 1-S_{i,k} = P[T_i \leq t_k]$. 

- In the simple setting, we have enough information to estimate $S_k$ non-parametrically.
$$\hat{S}_{k} = \hat{E}[S_{i,k}  ] = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^N I(T_i > t_k)}{N}$$
---

# Hazards

- The hazard at time $t_k$ is the risk of dying during the interval $(t_{k-1}, t_k]$. 
$$H_k = P[D_k = 1 \vert D_{k-1} = 0] = \frac{P[t_{k-1} < T \leq t_k]}{P[T > t_{k-1}]}$$

- For continuous time, the hazard is the derivative of the survival function, normalized by the proportion at risk

$$
\lambda(t) = \frac{\frac{d}{dt} S(t)}{S(t)}
$$

- We will mostly work with discrete-time hazards, but sometimes continuous time models are simpler to write down. 


---

# Kaplan-Meier Curves

- Suppose that participants are lost to follow-up at various times throughout the study.

  + Let $C_{i,k}$ equal 1 if participant $i$ is censored before time $t_k$ or 0 otherwise. 
  + Let $\bar{C}_k = (C_1, \dots, C_k)$ and $\bar{D}_k = (D_1, \dots, D_k)$.

- When people are censored at different times, estimating $S_k$ is harder.

- We can estimate $E[D_k \vert\ \bar{C}_k = 0, A = a]$ but this is not what we want. 

- We want $E[D_k(\bar{C}_k = 0) \vert A]$, the survival we would have observed if nobody had been censored before time $k$. 

---

# Kaplan-Meier Curves

- Key observation:
  $$S_{k} = \prod_{j = 1}^{k}\left(1 - H_j\right)$$

- Survival at time $t_{k}$ is the product of the probability of not dying during  any previous interval. 

---
# Estimating the Hazard

- In order to estimate $H_k$, we need censoring before time $t_k$ to be independent of death during interval $(t_{k-1}, t_k]$. 

$$D_k \ci \bar{C}_k \vert D_{k-1} = 0, A$$

- This is called *non-informative* censoring. 

- With this assumption, a non-parameteric estiamte of $H_k$ is 
$$\hat{H}_k = \frac{d_k}{N_k}$$

  + $d_k$ is the number of deaths observed in interval $k$ and 

  +  $N_k$ is the number *at risk* in interval $k$: 
    - The number of units that were known to be alive at time $t_{k-1}$ and were not censored at time $t_k$. 

---

# Kaplan-Meier Curves

- The plug-in estimator

$$\hat{S}_{k} = \prod_{j=1}^{k}\left(1 - \frac{d_j}{N_j} \right)$$ is a non-parametric estimate of sample average survival. 

- We can subset within values of $A$ to estimate group-specific survival. 

- We can use the trick of multiplying hazards to estimate survival, even when $H_k$ must be estimated parametrically.

# Comparing Survival Between Groups

- Let $\hat{S}_{1,k}$ and $\hat{S}_{0, k}$ be survival functions estimated for samples with $A = 1$ and $A = 0$ respectively.

- We could test for a difference between $\hat{S}_{1,k}$ and $\hat{S}_{0,k}$ at a single time point. 
  + Confidence intervals shown in previous plot, derived from binomial distribution of $d_k$.


---
# Comparing Survival Between Groups

- The commonly used log-rank test tests the null hypothesis that the two survival functions are the same. That is,
$$S_{1,k}  = S_{0,k} \qquad \forall k$$
- In the NHEFS data, the log-rank test gives a p-value of 0.005.

- We can also see from the estimated survival curves that $\hat{S}_{1,k} < \hat{S}_{0,k}$ for nearly all time points. 
  + Conclusion: Quitting smoking reduced survival in this sample?



---
# Parametric Estimates of Survival Curves

- Non-parametric estimates of $H_k$ can be unstable. 

- We may wish to condition on more covariates or continuous covariates. 

- We can instead fit a parametric (or semi-parametric) model for $H_k$.


---
# Cox Relative Risk Model

- The Cox relative risk model is
$$\lambda(t; Z) = \lambda_{0}(t)\exp(Z^\top \beta)$$ 

- $\lambda_0(t)$ is an arbitrary baseline hazard. 
 
- Semi-parametric because the form of $\lambda_0(t)$ is unspecified.

- This model says that the hazard ratio, $\frac{\lambda(t; Z)}{\lambda(t; Z^\prime)}$, is constant over time 
  + "Proportional hazards"
  
- Two extensions allow flexibility:
  1. Stratified Cox model
  2. Adding time-dependent covariates
  
---
# Stratified Cox Model 

- A stratified Cox model allows a different baseline hazard for different levels of a covariate.

- Let $V$ be a covariate on which we want to stratify. We model 

$$\lambda(t; V = v, Z) = \lambda_{0, v}(t)exp(Z^\top\beta)$$
- Since $\lambda_{0,v}$ can be estimated non-parametrically, proportional hazards can be violated for $V$. 

- $V$ must have a small number of levels. 

---
# Time Dependent Covariates

- We can generalize the Cox model so that some covariates can depend on time:
$$\lambda(t; Z(t)) = \lambda_0(t)\exp(Z(t)^\top \beta) $$

- This model no longer has proportional hazards restriction, we can specify any linear model for the hazard ratio. 

---
# Logistic Regression Model 

- When the hazard is small, we can approximate the relative risk model with a logistic regression:

- If $\lambda(t; Z)$ is small then $1-\lambda(t; Z) \approx 1$

- So $\log \lambda(t; Z) \approx \log \frac{\lambda(t; Z)}{1-\lambda(t; Z)}$.

- We can propose

$$\text{logit } P[D_k = 1 \vert D_{k-1} = 0, Z_k] = \theta_{0,k} + Z_k^\top \theta_z$$
- $\theta_{0, k}$ is a specified function of $Z$ and $t$ like

$$\theta_{0, k} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 k + \alpha_2 k^2$$

- We are now fully parametric because we had to specify the form of $\theta_{0,k}$

---
# Fitting the Logistic Regression

- To fit the proposed logistic regression, we need to convert our data into person-time format.

- Each person has one row for every time period in which they were alive and uncensored at the beginning of the time period. 
  + A variable `D` indicates whether the person died by the end of the time period. 

- People do not have rows for time periods after they died. 

- Usual standard errors are correct if the hazards model is correct. 

---
# Fitting the Logistic Regression in NHEFS
For the NHEFS data we fit the logistic regression
$$\text{logit } P[D_k = 1 \vert D_{k-1} = 0, Z_k] = \theta_{0,k} + \theta_1 A + \theta_2 A k + \theta_3 A k^2$$
$$\theta_{0, k} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 k + \alpha_2 k^2$$
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#Creating person-time data
library(survival)
dtime <- seq(120)
newdat <- survSplit(Surv(survtime, death) ~ qsmk, 
                    data = dat, cut = dtime) %>%
          mutate(time = survtime-1, 
                 timesq = time^2)
# This model is for no event
fit <- glm(death==0 ~ qsmk + I(qsmk*time) + I(qsmk*timesq) + 
                       time + timesq, family=binomial(), 
           data=newdat)
```


---
# Computing Survival from Estimated Hazards

- Once we have fit the logistic regression, we want to estimate $S_k$ for a particular combination of covariates $Z^*$. 

- We will use the same trick we used to compute K-M curves. 
$$\hat{S}_{k, Z^*} = \prod_{j \leq k}\left( 1 - \hat{H}_{j,Z^*}\right)$$

- Our estimate of the hazard $\hat{H}_{j,Z^*} = \hat{P}[D_j = 1 \vert D_{j-1} = 0, Z = Z^*]$ comes from the logistic regression model. 

- We can use the same trick for results from a Cox model (output automatically by `survfit` in the `Survival` package).

- Confidence intervals via bootstrapping

---

# Computing Survival in NHEFS

Next we estimate survival at each time for quitters and non-quitters:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
qsmk0 <- qsmk1 <- data.frame(time = seq(120)-1)%>% 
  mutate(timesq = time^2)
qsmk0$qsmk <- 0
qsmk1$qsmk <- 1

# Fitted values are 1-hazard
qsmk0$p_noevent0 <- predict(fit, qsmk0, type="response")
qsmk1$p_noevent1 <- predict(fit, qsmk1, type="response")

# Survival = prod (1 - hazard)
qsmk0$surv0 <- cumprod(qsmk0$p_noevent0)
qsmk1$surv1 <- cumprod(qsmk1$p_noevent1)

surv_data <-full_join(qsmk0, qsmk1, by = c("time", "timesq"))
```

```

---
# Censoring

- In the NHEFS data, we only have administrative censoring. 

- If we have censoring throughout the study, then the logistic model we fit will estimate 

$$P[D_k = 1 \vert D_{k-1} = 0, \bar{C}_k = 0, A]$$

- If $\bar{C}_k \ci D_k \vert D_{k-1} = 0, A$, then this is fine, the quantity above is equal to $$P[D_k = 1\vert D_{k-1} = 0, A]$$

- If censoring is informative, we need to condition on variables $L$ such that $\bar{C}_k \ci D_k \vert D_{k-1} = 0, A, L$. 

---

# IP Weighting

- What we have seen so far allows us to estimate the association between survival and treatment. 

- However, what we would like to estimate is the counterfactual survival had everyone recieved treatment $a$: 
$$E[D_{k}(A = a, \bar{C}_k = 0)]$$

- We can use the same IP weighting + marginal structural model approach we used in L5 for non-time to event data.

# IP Weighting

- We first compute standardized weights $$SW^{A} = \frac{P[A = A_i]}{P[A =A_i \vert L = L_i]}$$ exactly as we did before. 

- We can now convert our conditional hazard model into a structural marginal model 

$$\text{logit } P[D_k(A = a) = 1 \vert D_{k-1}(A = a) = 0] = \beta_{0,k} + \beta_1 a + \beta_2 a k + \beta_3 a k^2$$
- Estimate the parameters of the model using weighted data.

# IP Weighting Assumptions

- For consistent estimation we need: 

--

- Correctly specified propensity score model

- Correctly specified marginal structural model

- Non-informative censoring
  + We could have also included weights for censoring. 
  + Censoring weights may be time-varying.
  
  <!-- + Alternatively, if we had a set of variables $V$ such that $\bar{C}_k \ci D_k \vert A, V$ for all $k$, we could condition on $V$ in the marginal structural model.  -->

<!-- --- -->
<!-- # Adjusting for Non-Adherence -->


---
# Standardization

- Recall standardization from L5: 
  + Propose a conditional model for $E[Y \vert A, L]$ and then standardize over the distribution of $L$ in our sample.

- The procedure is the same for time to event data. 

- In this case, we need a parametric model for the hazard. 

- We then compute the conditional survival from the conditional hazard using the product trick. 

- Finally, we standardize the survival to the distribution of $L$ in our sample. 

- Results in NHEFS data are very similar to IP weighted results:
  + 120 month survival: $A = 0: 80.6\%$, $A = 1: 80.4\%$
  + Bootstrap based 95% confidence interval for difference: $(-4.6\%, 4.1\%)$
  
---
# Standardization Assumptions

- For consistent estimation we need: 

--

- Correctly specified conditional hazard model

- Non-informative censoring conditional on $A$ and $L$. 

---

# Survival vs Hazards

- So far we have focused on estimating counterfactual survival, the hazards have just been a means to an end. 

- Recall from our discussion of selection bias that time-specific hazard ratios have built-in selection bias. 
  + We can compute counterfactual hazard ratios but interpretation may be misleading.

- When a single hazard ratio from a Cox model is reported, it is a weighted average of time-specific hazard ratios. 
  + Interpretation is unclear if proportional hazards does not hold.

- Hernán and Robins propose that time-specific survival or risk are the most interpretable parameters. 

---
# Accelerated Failure Time Models

- An AFT is an alternative to the relative risks model. 

- Let $Y = \log T$. We can propose a log-linear model for survival time:  $$\log T = Y = Z^\top \beta + W\\\ T = \exp(Z^\top \beta)\exp(W)$$ 

- $W$ is a random variable with unspecified distribution. $W$ may not be mean 0. 

- Let $\Lambda_0(t) = P[\exp(W) < t]$ be the CDF of $S = \exp(W)$. The risk (CDF) of T is

$$R(t; Z, \beta) = P[T < t \vert Z, \beta] = \Lambda_0(t \exp(-Z^\top \beta))$$
---
# Accelerated Failure Time Models

- From the risk, we can calculate the hazard associated with the log-linear model for $T$:

$$\lambda(t; Z, \beta) = \frac{\frac{d}{dt}(-R(t; Z, \beta))}{1-R(t; Z, \beta)}$$

- Use the chain rule with $u(t) = t \exp(Z^\top \beta)$
$$\lambda(t; Z, \beta) = \frac{\exp(-Z^\top \beta)\frac{d}{du}(-\Lambda_0(u))}{1-\Lambda_0(u)}\\\
= \exp(-Z^\top \beta)\lambda_0(t \exp(-Z^\top \beta))$$


- Covariates have the effect of "speeding up" or "slowing down" the trajectory.

# Accelerated Failure Time Models



- The exponential model, in which $\lambda(t) = \lambda \exp(Z^\top \beta)$ is a special case of the AFT. 
  + It is also a special case of a relative risk model. 

- The more general Cox model is not a special case of the AFT model. 

- In the AFT, the parameter $\beta$ describes the ratio of expected survival times 

$$\frac{E[T \vert Z = Z_1]}{E[ T \vert Z = Z_2]} = \exp((Z_1 -Z_2)\beta)$$
---

# Structural Nested Models

- An alternative to IP weighting and standardization is G-estimation of structural nested models. 

- For survival data, we can consider a *structural nested accelerated failure time* model. 

- We start by motivating the method with a strong assumptions

$$T_{i}(A = a)/T_i(A = 0) = \exp(-\psi_1 a)$$
- This model says that the ratio of survival time under treatment $a$ and treatment 0 is exactly the same for all individuals. 

---
# G-estimation

- More generally, we could include covariates in the model 

$$T_{i}(A = a)/T_i(A = 0) = \exp(-\psi_1 a - \psi_2 a L_i)$$

- Rearranging

$$T_{i}(A = 0)= T_i(A = a) \exp(\psi_1 a + \psi_2 a L_i)$$

- Using consistency 
$$T_{i}(A = 0) = T_i \exp(\psi_1 A_i + \psi_2 A_i L_i)$$

---
# G-estimation

- Following our previous strategy, we would define 
$$H(\psi_1^\dagger, \psi^\dagger_2) = T_i\exp(\psi_1^\dagger A_i + \psi_2^\dagger A_i L_i)$$
- We would then search for a solution pair $(\hat{\psi}_1^\dagger, \hat{\psi}^\dagger_2)$ such that $H(\hat{\psi}_1^\dagger, \hat{\psi}^\dagger_2)$ is independent of $A$ in a regression model. 

--

- What is wrong with this approach in the survival setting?

--

- $T_i$ is unknown for everyone who was censored. 


---
# Example

- We conduct a 60 month study of treatment $A$ which is assigned randomly. 

- In everyone, $T(A = 1)/T(A = 0) = 0.667$ (the treatment reduces survival).

- We have three types participants in the study:
  + High risk: $T(A = 1)= 36$, $T(A = 0) = 24$
  + Medium risk: $T(A = 1) = 72$, $T(A = 0) = 48$
  + Lowest risk: $T(A = 1) = 108$, $T(A = 0) = 72$
  
- After 60 months, we have observed death times for all of the high risk group and none of the low risk group. 

- We have observed death times only for the treated medium risk group. 

- If we restrict our sample to only those with observed death times, risk group is no longer independent of treatment. 

---
# Artificial Censoring 

- In the example, if we could exclude the medium risk group, we would eliminate selection bias. 

- Generally, we want to exclude anyone for whom $T_i(A = a) > K$ or $T_i(A = 0) > K$ where $K$ is the end of the study. 

- If we knew the value of $\psi$, we could identify these individuals because we could calculate both $T_i(A = 0)$ and $T_i(A  = a).$ 

- We introduce a new indicator $\Delta_i(\psi^\dagger)$ which is 0 if unit $i$ should be excluded given $\psi^\dagger$.

---
# Estimation

- Once we have the artificial censoring indicator, $\Delta_i(\psi^\dagger)$, we can fit a logistic regression model in only data with $\Delta_i(\psi^\dagger) = 1$. 

- We do a grid search for values of $\psi^\dagger$ which make $H(\psi^\dagger)$ independent of $A.$


- In the NHEFS data, using the model $$T_i(A = 0) = T_i \exp(\psi A_i)$$ the resulting estimate of $\psi$ is  $-0.05 (95\%\ \text{CI:} -0.22 \text{ to } 0.33)$.

# Structural Nested AFTs in Practice

- Currently, there is a lack of software for structural nested AFTs. 

- Search algorithms for structural nested AFTs are not guaranteed to converge to unique solutions. 

- As a result, structural nested AFTs are rarely used in practice. 

- HR  and Vansteelandt and Joffe (2014) argue that structural nested models are underutilized.

# Competing Events

- Suppose we are interested in the time until cancer recurrence. 

- If some patients die before their cancer recurs and before the administrative censoring time, we now have three possible endpoints. 

- Three options:
  1. Count death as censoring
  2. Do not count death as censoring
  3. Condition on competing events
  4. Define a composite event death or cancer recurrence.
  
- In our example, let $Y_k$ be an indicator for recurrence at time $k$ and $D_k$ an indicator for death at time $k$.

# Option 1: Count Death as Censoring

+ We are estimating $E[Y_{k}(a, \bar{C}_k =0, \bar{D}_k = 0) \vert Y_{k-1}(a, \bar{C}_{k-1} =0, \bar{D}_{k-1} = 0) = 0]$, the expected hazard if nobody was censored and
  all causes of death were prevented. 
  + Is this a reasonable counterfactual?
  
- *Hazard under elimination of competing events*

- The effect on survival is called the *direct effect*

- Check for informative censoring -- if $Y_k$ and $D_k$ have shared causes, censoring is informative.

# Option 2: Do Not Count Death as Censoring

+ Patients who die have a value of 0 for the recurrence event for all time points after death.

+ That is, we continue to count patients who are dead as "at risk" for the primary event. 
  
+ Hazard without elimination of competing events

+ The effect on survival is the *total effect*.

+ Exchangeability requirements are less strong, common causes of $D_k$ and $Y_k$ do not create bias.

+ We could see a beneficial effect of treatment on recurrence due to an increase in the rate of death for treated patients.

# Option 3: Condition on competing events

+ Estimate $E[Y_{k}(a, \bar{C}_k =0) \vert D_{k-1}(a, \bar{C}_{k-1} =0) = 0, Y_{k-1}(a, \bar{C}_{k-1} =0) = 0]$

+ This is the cause-specific hazard

+ If there are common causes of treatment and $Y_k$ or of $Y_k$ and $Y_{k + 1}$, conditioning on $Y_k$ will introduce selection bias.

# Option 4: Composite Event

- The easiest option is to create a composite event death or recurrence. 

+ The causal question has now changed (maybe ok). 

+ A non-null result could indicate an effect on death or recurrence (or both).

# Time-Varying Treatments

- So far we have had a single treatment. 

- In some cases, the exposure may also change over time. 


---
# Example 


- Patients are treated for a disease over time. 

- At each appointment, the treatment decision for the next period is made, possibly based on current or past symptoms. 

- We observe an outcome $Y$. 

- For simplicity, assume we observe only two time points.

# Treatment Programs

- In this setting, we might be interested in the effect of the entire course of treatment $\bar{A} = (A_1, A_2)$. 
  - We are modeling a joint intervention. 
  
- With 2 time points, there are only four treatment strategies. 

- With $k$ time points there are $2^k$ treatment strategies. 

- How do we know which to compare?

---
# Treatment Strategies

- A treatment strategy is a rule for determining $A_k$ from a units past covariate values

$$g = (g_0(\bar{a}_{-1}, l_0), \dots, g_K(\bar{a}_{K-1}, \bar{l}_k))$$

- A treatment strategy is static if it does not depend on any covariates, only past treatments. 
  + In a static strategy, we could write out the entire program at the beginning of the study. 
  
- A treatment strategy is dynamic if it does depend on covariates. 

---
# Causal Contrasts

- The causal contrast we choose to look at will depend on the study. 

- We might be interested in comparing specific fixed programs, $E[Y(\bar{A} = \bar{a}_1)] - E[Y(\bar{A} = \bar{a}_2)]$ such as 
  + Always treat vs never treat: $\bar{a}_1 = (0, 0, \dots, 0)$, $\bar{a}_2 = (1, 1, \dots, 1)$
  + Begin treatment early and continue vs begin treatment later and continue: $\bar{a}_1 = (1, 1, \dots, 1)$, $\bar{a}_2 = (0,\dots, 0, 1, \dots, 1)$.
  
- Or we could compare one or more dynamic strategies $g$, $E[Y(g)]$ such as:
  + Always treat vs treat only when symptoms are present. 


- A strategy is deterministic if it assigns 0 or 1 to every treatment time. 

- A random strategy instead assigns a probability of treatment to each time. 
  + This probability may depend on past covariates. 
  + Sequentially randomized studies use random treatment strategies. 
  
---

# Positivity 

- We need a new definition of positivity for time-varying treatments. 

- For single point treatments, positivity requires that $P[A = a \vert L = l ] > 0$ for all $a$ and $l$ such that $f_L(l) > 0$. 

- Let $f_{\bar{A}_{k-1}, \bar{L}_k}$ be the joint pdf for the treatment history before point $k$ and the covariate history. 

- We need that 

$$f_{\bar{A}_{k-1}, \bar{L}_k}(\bar{a}_{k-1}, \bar{l}_k) > 0 \Rightarrow f_{A_{k} \vert \bar{A}_{k-1}, \bar{L}_k}(a_k \vert \bar{a}_{k-1}, \bar{l}_k) > 0$$
for all $(\bar{a}_k, \bar{l}_k)$

- This says that given past treatment history and covariates, no current treatments are excluded from possibility.

-  What if we are interested in a particular treatment strategy $g$ which excludes some possible histories?
  + For example, a patient can only recieve a treatment a certain number of times in a row before taking a break.
  
- The condition only needs to hold for treatment histories compatible with the treatment strategy. 

---
# Consistency 

- For a point treatment, consistency requires that $A = a \Rightarrow Y(a) = Y$. 

- For a static strategy, the condition $\bar{A} = \bar{a} \Rightarrow Y(\bar{a}) = Y$ is sufficient.

- For dynamic strategies, if $A_k = g_k(\bar{A}_{k-1}, \bar{L}_k)$ for all $k$ then $Y(g) = Y$.
