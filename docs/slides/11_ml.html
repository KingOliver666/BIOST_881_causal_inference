# Statistical Models Approximate Distributions

- Statistical models are approximations of joint or conditional probability distributions of observed data. 

--

- For example, if we have observations `\((x_1, y_1), \dots, (x_N, y_N)\)` and we fit a simple linear regression of `\(Y\)` on `\(X\)`, we are using the model
`$$y_i = \beta_0  + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i\\\ \epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma_y^2)$$`
  + We are approximating the conditional distribution of `\(Y \vert X\)` as normal with mean `\(\beta_0 + \beta_1X\)` and variance `\(\sigma_y^2\)`. 
 
--

- The linear model is a *class of distributions* parametrized by a finite set of parameters (three in our case).

- The OLS procedure identifies the single distribution within the model that best approximates the distribution of the observed data. 

`\(\newcommand{\ci}{\perp\!\!\!\perp}\)`


---
# Machine Learning

- Machine learning methods allow us to search larger classes of models for good approximations. 

- ML methods are sometimes described as "learning models automatically" from data. 

- However, this is a bit hazy since a model is just a class of distributions. 

--

- What is unique about ML methods is the model space is often very large and sometimes allowed to expand as the number of observations increases. 

- ML methods typically privelage some type of smoothness. 
  + A common way to achieve this is to over-parameterize a model and then penalize some or all of the parameters.
  + The penalty, controlling the effective number of parameters and degree of smoothness, can be learned from the data via cross-validation. 


---
# Example: Splines

- As an alternative to the linear model, we can add a fixed number parameters to the regression, for example fitting piece-wise functions. 

&lt;center&gt; 
&lt;img src="img/11_spline1.png" width="85%" /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

- With fixed knots, these models are only a little more flexible than the linear regression. 

---
# Example: Smoothing Splines

- An alternative is to approximate the conditional mean of `\(Y\)` given `\(X\)` as a smooth function of `\(X\)`. 

`$$y_i = h(x_i) + \epsilon_i \qquad h \in \mathcal{H}\\\ \epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma_y^2)$$` where `\(\mathcal{H}\)` is a class of "smooth" functions. 

--

- Smoothness could be defined by a restriction, for example on the second derivative
`$$\int (h^{\prime \prime}(x))^2 dx &lt; C$$`
  
  
- This class of models does not have a finite parametrization
  - However, it is possible to approximate functions in `\(\mathcal{H}\)` using a finite number of terms. 
  
---
# Example: Smoothing Splines

- We can define a spline basis, an infinite set of functions `\(g_1(x), g_2(x), \dots\)` that allows us to approximate any smooth function well. 
  + Given any smooth `\(h\)` and error tolerance `\(\varepsilon\)`, we can find a finite `\(K\)` and a set of coefficients `\(\beta_1, \dots, \beta_{K}\)` such that 

`$$\vert h(x) - \sum_{k = 1}^K\beta_k g_k(x) \vert &lt; \varepsilon \ \ \forall x$$`

--

- Using our spline basis, we replace the previous model with
`$$y_i = \sum_{k = 1}^{K(N)}\beta_k g_k(x_i) + \epsilon$$`  
  + Often `\(K(N) = N\)`
  + We then estimate the coefficients `\(\beta_1, \dots, \beta_K\)` via *penalized likelihood*. 
  + The penalty controls the degree of smoothness or the *effective number of parameters*. 
  

---
# Example: Smoothing Splines

&lt;center&gt; 
&lt;img src="img/11_spline2.png" width="85%" /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

---
# Bias-Variance Trade-Off

- With no penalization, we could perfectly interpolate the data.

- With an infinite penalty, the problem reduces to simple linear regession. 

- Too little smoothing:
  + The estimate will have a high variance because very little data contributes to the estimate at each point.
  
  
- Too much smoothing: 
  + The estimate has low variance but high bias. 
  
- In practice, we try to learn the amount of smoothing that best fits the data via cross-validation. 

---
# Bias-Variance Trade-Off

&lt;center&gt; 
&lt;img src="img/11_splines.png" width="62%" /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

---
# Example: Smoothing Splines

- Smoothing splines allow us to expand the class of models to we use to approximate the conditional distribution of `\(Y\)` given `\(X\)` compared to simple linear regression.

- Allowing the number of spline basis terms to increase as sample size increases provides "built-in" increasing model complexity. 


- When we fit a smoothing spline, we leverage having a lot of data in order to make weaker assumptions about the relationship between `\(E[Y \vert X]\)` and `\(X\)`. 
  
  
---
# ML Methods are Good at Approximating Data

- There are numerous ML methods which allow us to approximate distributions which much higher complexity than "plain" regressions. 

- These include 
  + variable selection methods like LASSO or stepwise selection. 
  + random forests
  + neural networks
  + empirical Bayes methods (learn the prior from the data)
  
- These are often described as prediction methods but we can also think of them as methods for approximating the distributions of data.


---
# Causal Effects


- Early in this course we defined a causal effect as the average treatment effect
`$$E[Y(1)] - E[Y(0)]$$`
or possibly the causal risk ratio 
`$$\frac{E[Y(1)]}{E[Y(0)]}$$`

- The quantity `\(E[Y(1)]\)` is a parameter of the counterfactual distribution of `\(Y\)` under the action setting `\(A\)` to 1. 

- Neither ML methods nor "standard" statistical methods can learn counterfactual distributions. They can only learn distributions of observed data. 

- We need to express our counterfactual quantity `\(E[Y(1)]\)` in terms of the probability distribution of the observations.


---
# Return to the g-Formula

- To link the probability distribution of the observed data and the counterfactual parameters we are interested in we need a DAG and the g-formula

`$$E[Y(a)] = \int E[Y \vert A = a, L = l]dF_l(l)$$`

- The DAG is necessary to identify a sufficient set of confounding variables.
  + The data cannot tell us what the correct DAG is. 
  + In some cases it can help. 
  
  
- For this reason, there cannot be any purely automated causal inference. 
  + Job security for statisticians. 

---
# g-Formula Methods

- We saw two ways to use the g-formula. 

- Option 1: Estimate `\(E[Y \vert A = a, L = l]\)`
  - Outcome modeling, or plug-in g-formula. 
  - Let `\(b(a, l) = E[Y \vert A=a, L=l]\)`
  
- Option 2: Estimate `\(P[A = a \vert L = l]\)`
  - Inverse probability weighting or treatment modeling
  - Let `\(\pi_a(l) = P[A = a \vert L = l]\)`
  
- Combo: Double robust methods combine both options. 
  - The bias of DR methods is proportional to `\(\left(\frac{1}{\hat{\pi}}- \frac{1}{\pi}\right)\left(\hat{b}-b\right)\)`, so DR methods will be less biased than either of the other options. 

---
# Machine Learning in g-Formula Methods

- We can use ML methods to estimate `\(\pi\)` or `\(b\)`. 

--

- **However**, we need to be careful!

--

- Neither outcome modeling alone or IP weighting will generally yield an asymptotically normal estimate for general ML methods. 
  + Both methods require that we pre-specify a parametric model with a fixed number of parameters. 
  + Standard errors will be incorrect if we just plug in a ML method.

--

- ML methods are not guaranteed to be consistent. 
  + We may not have included all of the confounders.
  + The set of models the ML method is searching may not include any models close to the truth. 
  + We may have included variables that induce bias (more on this later).

--

- For this reasons we should use a double robust estimator with ML methods. 



---
# Some Formal Definitions

- Let `\(P_0\)` be a probability distribution from which we can observe data.  

- A model `\(\mathcal{M}\)` is a set of models `\(\lbrace P_\theta \vert \theta \in \mathbb{R}^d \rbrace\)`. 

- A model is correctly specified if `\(P_0 \in \mathcal{M}\)`. A model is misspecified if `\(P_0 \not\in \mathcal{M}\)`. 

- We can define a *statistical target parameter* `\(\Psi\)` which is a mapping from `\(\mathcal{M}\)` to `\(\mathbb{R}\)`
  + For example, `\(\Psi\)` might be the mean. 
  + `\(\Psi\)` need not be one of the elements of `\(\theta\)`
  
- The target estimand (the thing we want to estimate) is `\(\Psi(P_0)\)`

---
# Empirical Probability Measures 

- Let `\(O_1, \dots, O_n\)` be iid draws from `\(P_0\)`.

- We define the empirical probability measure `\(P_n\)`
`$$P_n(X) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^n I(O_i \in X)$$`
- This defines a measure over sets `\(X\)` and therefore an empirical CDF. 

- `\(P_n\)` is the "histogram" measure. It contains all of the information about `\(O_1, \dots, O_n\)`. 

- `\(P_n\)` is an approximation of the true probability measure `\(P_0\)`. 

---
# Estimators

- We would like to find a function of the data, i.e. of `\(P_n\)` which is a good estimate of `\(\Psi(P_0)\)`. 

- An estimator is a rule for turning an empirical distribution into an estimate. 

- That is, an estimator is a function `\(\hat{\Psi}: \mathcal{M}_{NP} \to \mathbb{R}\)` where `\(\mathcal{M}_{NP}\)` is a non-parametric class of possible empirical distributions. 

- The *estimate* is `\(\hat{\Psi}(P_n)\)`. 

- `\(\hat{\Psi}(P_n)\)` is a random variable because it is a function of the random empirical distribution. 

---
# Asymptotic Linearity

- An estimator `\(\hat{\Psi}(P_n)\)` is asymptotically linear if

`$$\hat{\Psi}(P_n)- \Psi(P_0) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^n IC(O_i; \nu) + o_p(n^{-1/2})$$`
- Reminder of "little o" notation: `\(f(n)\)` is `\(o_p(1)\)` if `\(f(n) \to 0\)` as `\(n \to \infty\)`. 
  + `\(f(n)\)` is `\(o_p(r)\)` if `\(f(n)/r \to 0\)` as `\(n \to \infty\)`. 


- `\(\hat{\Psi}(P_n)-\Psi(P_0)\)` looks like an average of some function of each data point plus a remainder that goes to zero, even if blown up by `\(\sqrt{n}\)`. 

- The function `\(IC\)` is the influence function, or influence curve. 


---
# Asymptotic Linearity and the CLT

- If `\(\hat{\Psi}(P_n)\)` is asymptotically linear then a consequence of the central limit theorem is that

`$$\sqrt{n}(\hat{\Psi}(P_n) - \Psi(P_0)) \sim N(\mu_{IC}, \sigma^2_{IC})$$`

where `\(\mu_{IC} = E[IC(O_i; \nu)]\)` and `\(\sigma^2_{IC} = Var(IC(O_i; \nu)\)`. 

- Usually `\(\mu_{IC} = 0\)`. 

- Asymptotic linearity implies consistent, asymptotically normal estimators. 
  + "Nice" estimators that we can easily create Wald-type confidence intervals for. 
  
  `$$\hat{\Psi} \pm Z_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}\hat{\sigma}_{IC}/\sqrt{N}$$`

---
# Efficient Influence Functions

- The influence function is the most important thing to know about an asymptotically linear estimator. 
  + It tells us the mean and variance of the estimator. 
  
- Recall that an estimator is *efficient* if it has lower asymptotic variance than every other estimator in its class. 
  
---
# Efficient Influence Functions

- We will not show it but an important result is that *every* efficient estimator within a class has the sample influence function, called the *efficient influence function* (EIF). 

- The EIF can be derived making it possible to reverse engineer efficient estimators. 

- Note that the EIF is model specific. An estimator that is efficient within one model may not be efficient in a larger model. 
  + The maximum likelihood linear regression estimate is the efficient estimator in the simple linear model case we saw earlier. 
  + In the larger class of models with `\(E[Y \vert X]\)` a smooth function of `\(X\)`, we can do much better. 

---
# Targeted Minimum Loss Estimation (TMLE)

- TMLE is a double robust estimation strategy that is very similar to other DR estimators we have seen so far. 

- TMLE yields an asymptotically linear estimator as long as at least one of `\(\hat{\pi}\)` or `\(\hat{b}\)` are consistent. 
  + If both are consistent, the TMLE is also efficient.
  + These properties are also true of the other DR estimators we have seen.
  
---
# TMLE vs AIPW

- The augmented inverse probability weighted estimator (AIPW) is the estimator we saw previously as the Robins, Rotnitzky, and Zhao estimator. 

`$$\hat{E}[Y(1)] = \hat{\Delta}_{DR,1} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i = 1}^N \left \lbrace \hat{Y}_{1,i} + \frac{A_i}{\hat{\pi}(L_i)}\left(Y_i - \hat{Y}_{1,i} \right) \right \rbrace$$`

- TMLE and AIPW have the same influence function -- they are asymptotically equivalent.

- TMLE is guaranteed to yield an estimate of `\(E[Y(a)]\)` that is within the range of the original outcome data, while AIPW is not. 
  
- TMLE is also more stable than AIPTW with `\(\hat{\pi}(L_i)\)` are very small for units. 


---
# TMLE Initialization

The following steps produce the TMLE for a binary outcome and binary exposure. 

Step 1: Generate an initial estimate `\(\hat{b}_0\)` of `\(E[Y \vert A, L]\)`. 

Step 2: Estimate `\(\hat{\pi}_a = P[A = a \vert L]\)`. 
  + For binary exposure, we will estimate `\(\hat{\pi}_1\)` and then compute `\(\hat{\pi}_0 = 1-\hat{\pi}_1\)`. 

---
# TMLE One-Step Update


Step 3: Update the model of `\(E[Y \vert A, L]\)`. To do this we employ the "special covariate" strategy. Define
`$$H(A, L) = \frac{I(A = 1)}{\hat{\pi}_1(L)} - \frac{I(A = 0)}{\hat{\pi}_0(L)}$$`
Fit the model 

`$$logit(E[Y \vert A, L]) = logit(\hat{b}_0(A, L)) + \epsilon H(A,L)$$`
Note that the coefficient on the first term is 1, this is an offset. 

We get out an estimate, `\(\hat{\epsilon}\)`, called the fluctuation parameter. 

+ It should not be obvious why we fit this particular model.

---
# TMLE One-Step Update

Having estimated `\(\epsilon\)`, we now have a new outcome estimate,

`$$\hat{b}(A, L) = expit\left( logit(\hat{b}_0(A, L)) + \hat{\epsilon}H(A, L)\right)$$`

---
# TMLE Final Step

The lest step is to use standardization to estimate `\(E[Y(a)]\)`

`$$\hat{E}[Y(a)] = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^N \hat{b}(a, L_i)$$`

---
# TMLE with Continouous Outcome

- With a continuous outcome we can use exactly the same algorithm *except*

- Before we begin, we need to transform `\(Y\)` into the range `\([0, 1]\)`. 

- At the end we need to undo our transformation. 

- Notice that this procedure guarantees us an estimate within the observed range of `\(Y\)`. 

---
# Update Step Intuition

- The update step works because it directly solves a formula for the efficient influence function.

- However, we can have some intuition for why it is necessary without deriving the EIF. 

- The models we used to estimate `\(\hat{b}_0\)` and `\(\hat{\pi}\)` have made bias-variance trade-offs aimed at optimizing prediction of `\(Y\)` or `\(A\)` respectively. 

- However, predicting `\(Y\)` and `\(A\)` isn't our end goal. Our end goal is estimating the causal effect. 

- The update step adjusts the bias-variance trade-off to improve estimation of the target parameter. 
- This is the source of the "Targeted" in TMLE.

&lt;img src="img/11_roadmap.png" width="85%" /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

---
# Inference

- We can obtain the variance of the treatment effect estimated by TMLE by directly computing the influence function. 

- For TMLE, the influence function for the ATE is

`$$\hat{IC}(O_i) = (Y_i - \hat{b}(A_i, L_i))H(A_i, L_i) + (\hat{b}(1, L_i)- \hat{b}(0, L_i))- \hat{ATE}$$`

- We can estimate the variance of the ATE estimate as `$$\frac{Var(\hat{IC})}{N}$$`


---
# Super-Learner

- We need to decide what estimators to use to get `\(\hat{b}_0\)` and `\(\hat{\pi}\)` in the TMLE algorithm. 

- It may be hard to know which of many possible options will give the best results. 

- In super-learning, we use a weighted combination of many learners.
  + An "ensemble" learner, weights chosen via cross-validation.
  + The best of all worlds. 
  
- Super learning can improve performance of the TMLE. 

&lt;center&gt; 
&lt;img src="img/11_ring.png" width="35%" /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

---
# Super-Learner vs TMLE

- The super learner and the TMLE different, seprable methods. 

- Super learner is a machine learning (prediction) method. 

- TMLE is a causal inference method. 

- TMLE can be used with parametric models for `\(\hat{b}\)` and `\(\hat{\pi}\)`. 

- Super-learner can be used for other prediction problems, including as part of non-TMLE causal estimators.

# TMLE Extensions

Extensions of TMLE have been developed for

- Time-varying exposures, identifying optimal treatment regimes.

- Further improving the update step (collaborative TMLE)

- Mediation analysis



---
# Poisoned Covariates

- The best ML methods in the world cannot save us from a misspecified DAG or from unmeasured confounding. 

- Performance of the TMLE requires that all confounders are measured and included in the model. 

- As we've seen previously, there are some covariates that we should not include in our models, namely
  + Colliders
  + Children of the outcome (sneaky colliders)
  
- We also saw previously that including parents of the exposure that are not on a backdoor path can reduce precision and, if there are unmeasured confounders, increase bias.

---
# Other ML Opportunities

- The TMLE plus Super Learner framework requires that we observe all confounders and get some aspects of the DAG correct.

- Other methods have been proposed for circumstances where there might be unmeasured confounding.

- These methods are fundamentally controversial and reliant on assumptions. 
  + Data fundamentally cannot tell us about what is not in the data. 

- Hopefully one of the ML presentation groups will take us through "the deconfounder" by Wang and Blei and its associated controversy.
