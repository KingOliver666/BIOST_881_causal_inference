# Plan

1. Survival analysis Review

2. Causal analysis of time to event outcomes for a point treatment. 

3. Introduction about time varying treatments. 

`\(\newcommand{\ci}{\perp\!\!\!\perp}\)`

---

# Time to Event Data

- Simplest setting: 

- Participants are enrolled into a study at time 0 and receive a treatment `\(A\)`. 

- Participants are followed until either they die or the study ends. 

- We want to know if people who receive `\(A =1\)` live longer than people who receive `\(A = 0\)`. 

- The NHEFS study falls into this framework.
  + Administrative end of followup is Dec 31, 1992.
  + We might like to know if there is a difference in survival time for quitters and non-quitters.

---

# Time to Event Data

- Let `\(T_i\)` be the time of death for unit `\(i\)`. 
  + We can have counterfactual times of death `\(T_i(1)\)` and `\(T_i(0)\)`.
  
- If we follow all participants until the die, `\(T\)` is just an outcome like weight change, any of the tools we have learned so far apply. 

- Administrative censoring poses a problem: `\(T\)` is missing for participants with the longest survival times.

# Time to Event Data

Given this intractible censoring problem, we have two options:

1. Ask questions about time-specific survival (e.g. 120 month survival) or risk rather than questions about overall survival time. 

2. Use structural nested accelerated failure time models to estimate ratios of survival times comparing `\(A = a\)` to `\(A = 0\)`. 

---
# Survival 

- Let `\(t_1, \dots, t_K\)` be discrete, evenly spaced, time points at which data are recorded. Define `\(t_0\)` to be the beginning of the study. 

- Let `\(D_{i, k}\)` be an indicator that unit `\(i\)` has died before (or at) time `\(t_k\)`: `\(D_{i,k} = I(T_i \leq t_k)\)`

- Survival, `\(S_{i,k} = P[T_i &gt; t_k] = E[1-D_{i,k}]\)`, is the probability of unit `\(i\)` living beyond time `\(t_k\)`. 

- Alternatively, we might prefer risk `\(R_{i,k} = 1-S_{i,k} = P[T_i \leq t_k]\)`. 

- In the simple setting, we have enough information to estimate `\(S_k\)` non-parametrically.
`$$\hat{S}_{k} = \hat{E}[S_{i,k}  ] = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^N I(T_i &gt; t_k)}{N}$$`
---

# Hazards

- The hazard at time `\(t_k\)` is the risk of dying during the interval `\((t_{k-1}, t_k]\)`. 
`$$H_k = P[D_k = 1 \vert D_{k-1} = 0] = \frac{P[t_{k-1} &lt; T \leq t_k]}{P[T &gt; t_{k-1}]}$$`

- For continuous time, the hazard is the derivative of the survival function, normalized by the proportion at risk

$$
\lambda(t) = \frac{\frac{d}{dt} S(t)}{S(t)}
$$

- We will mostly work with discrete-time hazards, but sometimes continuous time models are simpler to write down. 


---

# Kaplan-Meier Curves

- Suppose that participants are lost to follow-up at various times throughout the study.

  + Let `\(C_{i,k}\)` equal 1 if participant `\(i\)` is censored before time `\(t_k\)` or 0 otherwise. 
  + Let `\(\bar{C}_k = (C_1, \dots, C_k)\)` and `\(\bar{D}_k = (D_1, \dots, D_k)\)`.

- When people are censored at different times, estimating `\(S_k\)` is harder.

- We can estimate `\(E[D_k \vert\ \bar{C}_k = 0, A = a]\)` but this is not what we want. 

- We want `\(E[D_k(\bar{C}_k = 0) \vert A]\)`, the survival we would have observed if nobody had been censored before time `\(k\)`. 

---

# Kaplan-Meier Curves

- Key observation:
  `$$S_{k} = \prod_{j = 1}^{k}\left(1 - H_j\right)$$`

- Survival at time `\(t_{k}\)` is the product of the probability of not dying during  any previous interval. 

---
# Estimating the Hazard

- In order to estimate `\(H_k\)`, we need censoring before time `\(t_k\)` to be independent of death during interval `\((t_{k-1}, t_k]\)`. 

`$$D_k \ci \bar{C}_k \vert D_{k-1} = 0, A$$`

- This is called *non-informative* censoring. 

- With this assumption, a non-parameteric estiamte of `\(H_k\)` is 
`$$\hat{H}_k = \frac{d_k}{N_k}$$`

  + `\(d_k\)` is the number of deaths observed in interval `\(k\)` and 

  +  `\(N_k\)` is the number *at risk* in interval `\(k\)`: 
    - The number of units that were known to be alive at time `\(t_{k-1}\)` and were not censored at time `\(t_k\)`. 

---

# Kaplan-Meier Curves

- The plug-in estimator

`$$\hat{S}_{k} = \prod_{j=1}^{k}\left(1 - \frac{d_j}{N_j} \right)$$` is a non-parametric estimate of sample average survival. 

- We can subset within values of `\(A\)` to estimate group-specific survival. 

- We can use the trick of multiplying hazards to estimate survival, even when `\(H_k\)` must be estimated parametrically.

&lt;img src="8_survival_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
# Comparing Survival Between Groups

- Let `\(\hat{S}_{1,k}\)` and `\(\hat{S}_{0, k}\)` be survival functions estimated for samples with `\(A = 1\)` and `\(A = 0\)` respectively.

- We could test for a difference between `\(\hat{S}_{1,k}\)` and `\(\hat{S}_{0,k}\)` at a single time point. 
  + Confidence intervals shown in previous plot, derived from binomial distribution of `\(d_k\)`.


---
# Comparing Survival Between Groups

- The commonly used log-rank test tests the null hypothesis that the two survival functions are the same. That is,
`$$S_{1,k}  = S_{0,k} \qquad \forall k$$`
- In the NHEFS data, the log-rank test gives a p-value of 0.005.

- We can also see from the estimated survival curves that `\(\hat{S}_{1,k} &lt; \hat{S}_{0,k}\)` for nearly all time points. 
  + Conclusion: Quitting smoking reduced survival in this sample?



---
# Parametric Estimates of Survival Curves

- Non-parametric estimates of `\(H_k\)` can be unstable. 

- We may wish to condition on more covariates or continuous covariates. 

- We can instead fit a parametric (or semi-parametric) model for `\(H_k\)`.


---
# Cox Relative Risk Model

- The Cox relative risk model is
`$$\lambda(t; Z) = \lambda_{0}(t)\exp(Z^\top \beta)$$` 

- `\(\lambda_0(t)\)` is an arbitrary baseline hazard. 
 
- Semi-parametric because the form of `\(\lambda_0(t)\)` is unspecified.

- This model says that the hazard ratio, `\(\frac{\lambda(t; Z)}{\lambda(t; Z^\prime)}\)`, is constant over time 
  + "Proportional hazards"
  
- Two extensions allow flexibility:
  1. Stratified Cox model
  2. Adding time-dependent covariates
  
---
# Stratified Cox Model 

- A stratified Cox model allows a different baseline hazard for different levels of a covariate.

- Let `\(V\)` be a covariate on which we want to stratify. We model 

`$$\lambda(t; V = v, Z) = \lambda_{0, v}(t)exp(Z^\top\beta)$$`
- Since `\(\lambda_{0,v}\)` can be estimated non-parametrically, proportional hazards can be violated for `\(V\)`. 

- `\(V\)` must have a small number of levels. 

---
# Time Dependent Covariates

- We can generalize the Cox model so that some covariates can depend on time:
$$\lambda(t; Z(t)) = \lambda_0(t)\exp(Z(t)^\top \beta) $$

- This model no longer has proportional hazards restriction, we can specify any linear model for the hazard ratio. 

---
# Logistic Regression Model 

- When the hazard is small, we can approximate the relative risk model with a logistic regression:

- If `\(\lambda(t; Z)\)` is small then `\(1-\lambda(t; Z) \approx 1\)`

- So `\(\log \lambda(t; Z) \approx \log \frac{\lambda(t; Z)}{1-\lambda(t; Z)}\)`.

- We can propose

`$$\text{logit } P[D_k = 1 \vert D_{k-1} = 0, Z_k] = \theta_{0,k} + Z_k^\top \theta_z$$`
- `\(\theta_{0, k}\)` is a specified function of `\(Z\)` and `\(t\)` like

`$$\theta_{0, k} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 k + \alpha_2 k^2$$`

- We are now fully parametric because we had to specify the form of `\(\theta_{0,k}\)`

---
# Fitting the Logistic Regression

- To fit the proposed logistic regression, we need to convert our data into person-time format.

- Each person has one row for every time period in which they were alive and uncensored at the beginning of the time period. 
  + A variable `D` indicates whether the person died by the end of the time period. 

- People do not have rows for time periods after they died. 

- Usual standard errors are correct if the hazards model is correct. 

---
# Fitting the Logistic Regression in NHEFS
For the NHEFS data we fit the logistic regression
`$$\text{logit } P[D_k = 1 \vert D_{k-1} = 0, Z_k] = \theta_{0,k} + \theta_1 A + \theta_2 A k + \theta_3 A k^2$$`
`$$\theta_{0, k} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 k + \alpha_2 k^2$$`

```r
#Creating person-time data
library(survival)
dtime &lt;- seq(120)
newdat &lt;- survSplit(Surv(survtime, death) ~ qsmk, 
                    data = dat, cut = dtime) %&gt;%
          mutate(time = survtime-1, 
                 timesq = time^2)
# This model is for no event
fit &lt;- glm(death==0 ~ qsmk + I(qsmk*time) + I(qsmk*timesq) + 
                       time + timesq, family=binomial(), 
           data=newdat)
```


---
# Computing Survival from Estimated Hazards

- Once we have fit the logistic regression, we want to estimate `\(S_k\)` for a particular combination of covariates `\(Z^*\)`. 

- We will use the same trick we used to compute K-M curves. 
`$$\hat{S}_{k, Z^*} = \prod_{j \leq k}\left( 1 - \hat{H}_{j,Z^*}\right)$$`

- Our estimate of the hazard `\(\hat{H}_{j,Z^*} = \hat{P}[D_j = 1 \vert D_{j-1} = 0, Z = Z^*]\)` comes from the logistic regression model. 

- We can use the same trick for results from a Cox model (output automatically by `survfit` in the `Survival` package).

- Confidence intervals via bootstrapping

---

# Computing Survival in NHEFS

Next we estimate survival at each time for quitters and non-quitters:


```r
qsmk0 &lt;- qsmk1 &lt;- data.frame(time = seq(120)-1)%&gt;% 
  mutate(timesq = time^2)
qsmk0$qsmk &lt;- 0
qsmk1$qsmk &lt;- 1

# Fitted values are 1-hazard
qsmk0$p_noevent0 &lt;- predict(fit, qsmk0, type="response")
qsmk1$p_noevent1 &lt;- predict(fit, qsmk1, type="response")

# Survival = prod (1 - hazard)
qsmk0$surv0 &lt;- cumprod(qsmk0$p_noevent0)
qsmk1$surv1 &lt;- cumprod(qsmk1$p_noevent1)

surv_data &lt;-full_join(qsmk0, qsmk1, by = c("time", "timesq"))
```

---
# Censoring

- In the NHEFS data, we only have administrative censoring. 

- If we have censoring throughout the study, then the logistic model we fit will estimate 

`$$P[D_k = 1 \vert D_{k-1} = 0, \bar{C}_k = 0, A]$$`

- If `\(\bar{C}_k \ci D_k \vert D_{k-1} = 0, A\)`, then this is fine, the quantity above is equal to `$$P[D_k = 1\vert D_{k-1} = 0, A]$$`

- If censoring is informative, we need to condition on variables `\(L\)` such that `\(\bar{C}_k \ci D_k \vert D_{k-1} = 0, A, L\)`. 

---

# IP Weighting

- What we have seen so far allows us to estimate the association between survival and treatment. 

- However, what we would like to estimate is the counterfactual survival had everyone recieved treatment `\(a\)`: 
`$$E[D_{k}(A = a, \bar{C}_k = 0)]$$`

- We can use the same IP weighting + marginal structural model approach we used in L5 for non-time to event data.

&lt;/center&gt;



---
# IP Weighting

- We first compute standardized weights `$$SW^{A} = \frac{P[A = A_i]}{P[A =A_i \vert L = L_i]}$$` exactly as we did before. 

- We can now convert our conditional hazard model into a structural marginal model 

`$$\text{logit } P[D_k(A = a) = 1 \vert D_{k-1}(A = a) = 0] = \beta_{0,k} + \beta_1 a + \beta_2 a k + \beta_3 a k^2$$`
- Estimate the parameters of the model using weighted data. 

---
# IP Weighted Estimates in NHEFS

&lt;img src="8_survival_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

120 month survival estimate: `\(A = 0: 80.5\%\)`, `\(A = 1: 80.7\%\)`

95% CI for difference: `\((-4.1\%, 3.7\%)\)`

---
# IP Weighting Assumptions

- For consistent estimation we need: 

--

- Correctly specified propensity score model

- Correctly specified marginal structural model

- Non-informative censoring
  + We could have also included weights for censoring. 
  + Censoring weights may be time-varying.
  
  &lt;!-- + Alternatively, if we had a set of variables `\(V\)` such that `\(\bar{C}_k \ci D_k \vert A, V\)` for all `\(k\)`, we could condition on `\(V\)` in the marginal structural model.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- --- --&gt;
&lt;!-- # Adjusting for Non-Adherence --&gt;


---
# Standardization

- Recall standardization from L5: 
  + Propose a conditional model for `\(E[Y \vert A, L]\)` and then standardize over the distribution of `\(L\)` in our sample.

- The procedure is the same for time to event data. 

- In this case, we need a parametric model for the hazard. 

- We then compute the conditional survival from the conditional hazard using the product trick. 

- Finally, we standardize the survival to the distribution of `\(L\)` in our sample. 

- Results in NHEFS data are very similar to IP weighted results:
  + 120 month survival: `\(A = 0: 80.6\%\)`, `\(A = 1: 80.4\%\)`
  + Bootstrap based 95% confidence interval for difference: `\((-4.6\%, 4.1\%)\)`
  
---
# Standardization Assumptions

- For consistent estimation we need: 

--

- Correctly specified conditional hazard model

- Non-informative censoring conditional on `\(A\)` and `\(L\)`. 

---

# Survival vs Hazards

- So far we have focused on estimating counterfactual survival, the hazards have just been a means to an end. 

- Recall from our discussion of selection bias that time-specific hazard ratios have built-in selection bias. 
  + We can compute counterfactual hazard ratios but interpretation may be misleading.

- When a single hazard ratio from a Cox model is reported, it is a weighted average of time-specific hazard ratios. 
  + Interpretation is unclear if proportional hazards does not hold.

- Hernán and Robins propose that time-specific survival or risk are the most interpretable parameters. 

---
# Accelerated Failure Time Models

- An AFT is an alternative to the relative risks model. 

- Let `\(Y = \log T\)`. We can propose a log-linear model for survival time:  `$$\log T = Y = Z^\top \beta + W\\\ T = \exp(Z^\top \beta)\exp(W)$$` 

- `\(W\)` is a random variable with unspecified distribution. `\(W\)` may not be mean 0. 

- Let `\(\Lambda_0(t) = P[\exp(W) &lt; t]\)` be the CDF of `\(S = \exp(W)\)`. The risk (CDF) of T is

`$$R(t; Z, \beta) = P[T &lt; t \vert Z, \beta] = \Lambda_0(t \exp(-Z^\top \beta))$$`
---
# Accelerated Failure Time Models

- From the risk, we can calculate the hazard associated with the log-linear model for `\(T\)`:

`$$\lambda(t; Z, \beta) = \frac{\frac{d}{dt}(-R(t; Z, \beta))}{1-R(t; Z, \beta)}$$`

- Use the chain rule with `\(u(t) = t \exp(Z^\top \beta)\)`
`$$\lambda(t; Z, \beta) = \frac{\exp(-Z^\top \beta)\frac{d}{du}(-\Lambda_0(u))}{1-\Lambda_0(u)}\\\
= \exp(-Z^\top \beta)\lambda_0(t \exp(-Z^\top \beta))$$`


- Covariates have the effect of "speeding up" or "slowing down" the trajectory.

# Accelerated Failure Time Models 

&lt;center&gt; 

&lt;img src="img/8_aft.png" width="95%" /&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;


---
# Accelerated Failure Time Models



- The exponential model, in which `\(\lambda(t) = \lambda \exp(Z^\top \beta)\)` is a special case of the AFT. 
  + It is also a special case of a relative risk model. 

- The more general Cox model is not a special case of the AFT model. 

- In the AFT, the parameter `\(\beta\)` describes the ratio of expected survival times 

`$$\frac{E[T \vert Z = Z_1]}{E[ T \vert Z = Z_2]} = \exp((Z_1 -Z_2)\beta)$$`
---

# Structural Nested Models

- An alternative to IP weighting and standardization is G-estimation of structural nested models. 

- For survival data, we can consider a *structural nested accelerated failure time* model. 

- We start by motivating the method with a strong assumptions

`$$T_{i}(A = a)/T_i(A = 0) = \exp(-\psi_1 a)$$`
- This model says that the ratio of survival time under treatment `\(a\)` and treatment 0 is exactly the same for all individuals. 

---
# G-estimation

- More generally, we could include covariates in the model 

`$$T_{i}(A = a)/T_i(A = 0) = \exp(-\psi_1 a - \psi_2 a L_i)$$`

- Rearranging

`$$T_{i}(A = 0)= T_i(A = a) \exp(\psi_1 a + \psi_2 a L_i)$$`

- Using consistency 
`$$T_{i}(A = 0) = T_i \exp(\psi_1 A_i + \psi_2 A_i L_i)$$`

---
# G-estimation

- Following our previous strategy, we would define 
`$$H(\psi_1^\dagger, \psi^\dagger_2) = T_i\exp(\psi_1^\dagger A_i + \psi_2^\dagger A_i L_i)$$`
- We would then search for a solution pair `\((\hat{\psi}_1^\dagger, \hat{\psi}^\dagger_2)\)` such that `\(H(\hat{\psi}_1^\dagger, \hat{\psi}^\dagger_2)\)` is independent of `\(A\)` in a regression model. 

--

- What is wrong with this approach in the survival setting?

--

- `\(T_i\)` is unknown for everyone who was censored. 


---
# Example

- We conduct a 60 month study of treatment `\(A\)` which is assigned randomly. 

- In everyone, `\(T(A = 1)/T(A = 0) = 0.667\)` (the treatment reduces survival).

- We have three types participants in the study:
  + High risk: `\(T(A = 1)= 36\)`, `\(T(A = 0) = 24\)`
  + Medium risk: `\(T(A = 1) = 72\)`, `\(T(A = 0) = 48\)`
  + Lowest risk: `\(T(A = 1) = 108\)`, `\(T(A = 0) = 72\)`
  
- After 60 months, we have observed death times for all of the high risk group and none of the low risk group. 

- We have observed death times only for the treated medium risk group. 

- If we restrict our sample to only those with observed death times, risk group is no longer independent of treatment. 

---
# Artificial Censoring 

- In the example, if we could exclude the medium risk group, we would eliminate selection bias. 

- Generally, we want to exclude anyone for whom `\(T_i(A = a) &gt; K\)` or `\(T_i(A = 0) &gt; K\)` where `\(K\)` is the end of the study. 

- If we knew the value of `\(\psi\)`, we could identify these individuals because we could calculate both `\(T_i(A = 0)\)` and `\(T_i(A  = a).\)` 

- We introduce a new indicator `\(\Delta_i(\psi^\dagger)\)` which is 0 if unit `\(i\)` should be excluded given `\(\psi^\dagger\)`.

---
# Estimation

- Once we have the artificial censoring indicator, `\(\Delta_i(\psi^\dagger)\)`, we can fit a logistic regression model in only data with `\(\Delta_i(\psi^\dagger) = 1\)`. 

- We do a grid search for values of `\(\psi^\dagger\)` which make `\(H(\psi^\dagger)\)` independent of `\(A.\)`


- In the NHEFS data, using the model `$$T_i(A = 0) = T_i \exp(\psi A_i)$$` the resulting estimate of `\(\psi\)` is  `\(-0.05 (95\%\ \text{CI:} -0.22 \text{ to } 0.33)\)`.

# Structural Nested AFTs in Practice

- Currently, there is a lack of software for structural nested AFTs. 

- Search algorithms for structural nested AFTs are not guaranteed to converge to unique solutions. 

- As a result, structural nested AFTs are rarely used in practice. 

- HR  and Vansteelandt and Joffe (2014) argue that structural nested models are underutilized.

# Competing Events

- Suppose we are interested in the time until cancer recurrence. 

- If some patients die before their cancer recurs and before the administrative censoring time, we now have three possible endpoints. 

- Three options:
  1. Count death as censoring
  2. Do not count death as censoring
  3. Condition on competing events
  4. Define a composite event death or cancer recurrence.
  
- In our example, let `\(Y_k\)` be an indicator for recurrence at time `\(k\)` and `\(D_k\)` an indicator for death at time `\(k\)`. 
  
---
# Option 1: Count Death as Censoring

+ We are estimating `\(E[Y_{k}(a, \bar{C}_k =0, \bar{D}_k = 0) \vert Y_{k-1}(a, \bar{C}_{k-1} =0, \bar{D}_{k-1} = 0) = 0]\)`, the expected hazard if nobody was censored and
  all causes of death were prevented. 
  + Is this a reasonable counterfactual?
  
- *Hazard under elimination of competing events*

- The effect on survival is called the *direct effect*

- Check for informative censoring -- if `\(Y_k\)` and `\(D_k\)` have shared causes, censoring is informative.

&lt;img src="img/8_ysthfig2.png" width="75%" /&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;  
  

---
# Option 2: Do Not Count Death as Censoring

+ Patients who die have a value of 0 for the recurrence event for all time points after death.

+ That is, we continue to count patients who are dead as "at risk" for the primary event. 
  
+ Hazard without elimination of competing events

+ The effect on survival is the *total effect*.

+ Exchangeability requirements are less strong, common causes of `\(D_k\)` and `\(Y_k\)` do not create bias.

+ We could see a beneficial effect of treatment on recurrence due to an increase in the rate of death for treated patients.


&lt;center&gt; 

&lt;img src="img/8_ysthfig2.png" width="75%" /&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;  

---
# Option 3: Condition on competing events

+ Estimate `\(E[Y_{k}(a, \bar{C}_k =0) \vert D_{k-1}(a, \bar{C}_{k-1} =0) = 0, Y_{k-1}(a, \bar{C}_{k-1} =0) = 0]\)`

+ This is the cause-specific hazard

+ If there are common causes of treatment and `\(Y_k\)` or of `\(Y_k\)` and `\(Y_{k + 1}\)`, conditioning on `\(Y_k\)` will introduce selection bias. 

&lt;center&gt; 

&lt;img src="img/8_ysthfig3.png" width="75%" /&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;  

---
# Option 4: Composite Event

- The easiest option is to create a composite event death or recurrence. 

+ The causal question has now changed (maybe ok). 

+ A non-null result could indicate an effect on death or recurrence (or both). 


---

# Time-Varying Treatments

- So far we have had a single treatment. 

- In some cases, the exposure may also change over time. 


---
# Example 


- Patients are treated for a disease over time. 

- At each appointment, the treatment decision for the next period is made, possibly based on current or past symptoms. 

- We observe an outcome `\(Y\)`. 

- For simplicity, assume we observe only two time points.

# Treatment Programs

- In this setting, we might be interested in the effect of the entire course of treatment `\(\bar{A} = (A_1, A_2)\)`. 
  - We are modeling a joint intervention. 
  
- With 2 time points, there are only four treatment strategies. 

- With `\(k\)` time points there are `\(2^k\)` treatment strategies. 

- How do we know which to compare?

---
# Treatment Strategies

- A treatment strategy is a rule for determining `\(A_k\)` from a units past covariate values

`$$g = (g_0(\bar{a}_{-1}, l_0), \dots, g_K(\bar{a}_{K-1}, \bar{l}_k))$$`

- A treatment strategy is static if it does not depend on any covariates, only past treatments. 
  + In a static strategy, we could write out the entire program at the beginning of the study. 
  
- A treatment strategy is dynamic if it does depend on covariates. 

---
# Causal Contrasts

- The causal contrast we choose to look at will depend on the study. 

- We might be interested in comparing specific fixed programs, `\(E[Y(\bar{A} = \bar{a}_1)] - E[Y(\bar{A} = \bar{a}_2)]\)` such as 
  + Always treat vs never treat: `\(\bar{a}_1 = (0, 0, \dots, 0)\)`, `\(\bar{a}_2 = (1, 1, \dots, 1)\)`
  + Begin treatment early and continue vs begin treatment later and continue: `\(\bar{a}_1 = (1, 1, \dots, 1)\)`, `\(\bar{a}_2 = (0,\dots, 0, 1, \dots, 1)\)`.
  
- Or we could compare one or more dynamic strategies `\(g\)`, `\(E[Y(g)]\)` such as:
  + Always treat vs treat only when symptoms are present. 


- A strategy is deterministic if it assigns 0 or 1 to every treatment time. 

- A random strategy instead assigns a probability of treatment to each time. 
  + This probability may depend on past covariates. 
  + Sequentially randomized studies use random treatment strategies. 
  
---

# Positivity 

- We need a new definition of positivity for time-varying treatments. 

- For single point treatments, positivity requires that `\(P[A = a \vert L = l ] &gt; 0\)` for all `\(a\)` and `\(l\)` such that `\(f_L(l) &gt; 0\)`. 

- Let `\(f_{\bar{A}_{k-1}, \bar{L}_k}\)` be the joint pdf for the treatment history before point `\(k\)` and the covariate history. 

- We need that 

`$$f_{\bar{A}_{k-1}, \bar{L}_k}(\bar{a}_{k-1}, \bar{l}_k) &gt; 0 \Rightarrow f_{A_{k} \vert \bar{A}_{k-1}, \bar{L}_k}(a_k \vert \bar{a}_{k-1}, \bar{l}_k) &gt; 0$$`
for all `\((\bar{a}_k, \bar{l}_k)\)`

- This says that given past treatment history and covariates, no current treatments are excluded from possibility.

-  What if we are interested in a particular treatment strategy `\(g\)` which excludes some possible histories?
  + For example, a patient can only recieve a treatment a certain number of times in a row before taking a break.
  
- The condition only needs to hold for treatment histories compatible with the treatment strategy. 

---
# Consistency 

- For a point treatment, consistency requires that `\(A = a \Rightarrow Y(a) = Y\)`. 

- For a static strategy, the condition `\(\bar{A} = \bar{a} \Rightarrow Y(\bar{a}) = Y\)` is sufficient.

- For dynamic strategies, if `\(A_k = g_k(\bar{A}_{k-1}, \bar{L}_k)\)` for all `\(k\)` then `\(Y(g) = Y\)`.
