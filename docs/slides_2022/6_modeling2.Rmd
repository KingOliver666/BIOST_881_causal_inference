# Last Time

- Parametric versions of IP weighting and standardization.

- Marginal structural models are models for counterfactuals 

$$
E[Y(a)] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 a
$$

- IP weighting and standardization are both "g-methods".

# This Time

- g-Estimation and structural nested models

- More on double robust estimators?

- Propensity Scores
