For this activity, don't use the slides. 

In pairs, write down the definition for one of these terms (Jean will assign one term to each pair):

- Counterfactual

- Average treatment effect

- Consistency (in the causal sense not the statistical sense)

- Exchangeability

- Interference

1. Are $U_2$ and $L_1$ $d$-separated?

2. $U_1$ and $L_1$ are un-measured. Is there a set $\mathcal{V}$ of measured variables such that 

$$ Y(a) \ci A \vert \mathcal{V}?$$

- We are interested in the effect of a genetic variant, $G$ on an outcome $Y$. 

- Participants who require surgery, either for $Y$ or a different condition are recruited into a genetic study. 

- The variant $G$ could affect $Y$ and could also affect other medical conditions that require surgery. 

- Draw a DAG of this scenario.

- Would you expect selection bias to affect the estimate of $G$ on $Y$? Why/why not?

Match the estimator with statements that are true about it. 
.pull-left[
**Estimator**

- Hajek Estimator

- G-Computation

- AIPW estimator from Robins, Rotnitzky and Zhao (1994)

- Subclassification estimator

- Bang and Robins estimator

- Adjusting for propensity score as a linear covariate. 
]

.pull-right[

** Statements**

- Consistent if PS model is correct

- Consistent if outcome model is correct

- Not consistent 

- These two are asymptotically equivalent

- More accurate using estimated PS than using true PS.
